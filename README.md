## Description

I created an application for a user to search the weather outlook for mulitple cities

Through this project: 
- I gained experience using jQuery and 3rd party API's like days.js and Open Weather Map.
- I have a better understanding of how to use local storage to save user
- i gained experience using bootstrap


## Usage

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN a user searches for a city
THEN they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN the user views current weather conditions for that city
THEN they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN the user views future weather conditions for that city
THEN they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, the temperature, the wind speed, the humidity, and an icon representation of weather conditions
WHEN the user clicks on a city in the search history
THEN they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
